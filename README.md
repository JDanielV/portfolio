# Web Portfolio

I appreciate you taking the time to visit my Web Portfolio's GitHub repo!

** PARDON MY DUST **

Please excuse any visual bugs you may come accross, this is a work in progress and I'm adding on things and fixing others as my availability allows it.

ABOUT THE WEB PORTFOLIO -

 - It was built using React and SASS (CSS) for the front end
 - Express for the backend (for the contact form)
 - It features custom animations for the Hero section, as well as library animations for the Projects section (SwiperJS for MOBILE view, AOS for TABLET/DESKTOP views)

ABOUT TERRANOVA WEBSITE - 

- Developed this website for a client in Downtown Vancouver (CA)
- Built with React & SASS (CSS) for the front end
- Express for the backend (contact form)
- Made site bilingual with i18next library (English/Spanish)
- It features library animations (AOS) in the Products and Services sections

ABOUT TORUM WEBSITE (PRACTICE) -

- Built with React + SASS (CSS)
- For the sake of practice, I replicated from the ground-up a landing website I came across the web (https://intro.torum.com/?next=/) - I am not endorsing their platform
- I included a Typewriter effect for the Hero Title, built mostly with Javascript and some details with SASS/CSS custom animations
- It features custom animations for the Mobile App section, and custom animations for the "Future Development" section (SwiperJS)

ABOUT LIGHT MIND PROJECT (VIDEO)

- This was the first web app I developed on my own, when graduating from a Web Development bootcamp
- Built under tight time constraints (10 days while also attending to the Bootcamp program full-time, with other activities)
- Used React + SASS (CSS) for the front end
- Express for the backend (to store & retrieve user data)
- Still planning on developing some mising features (EDIT posts, integrate a Database & simple user authentication)


Again - thank you so much for taking the time to read this & explore my portfolio!
